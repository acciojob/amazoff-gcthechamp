This is a Springboot application which would excellently serve as a backend for a food delivery management system. The basic function of this application is taking orders which have their respective delivery times and assigning each order to a delivery partner, which would be in-charge of delivering that order by the given delivery time.
It consists of a total of 13 REST APIs to carry out various operations like adding orders, adding delivery partners, linking orders with delivery partners, finding orders and partners by their respective IDs, finding orders left after a given time, and so on.
The essential model classes were the Order class and DeliveryPartner class.    
Hashmaps have been used as dummy databases. Postman was used to hit and test the APIs.
